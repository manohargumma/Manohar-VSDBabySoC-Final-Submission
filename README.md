## 1. Project Summary  
This repository consolidates my complete work on the VSDBabySoC project — from RTL functional modelling through to GDSII generation and timing closure.  It incorporates work carried out in the following prior repositories:

- [Manohar_RTL2GDS](https://github.com/manohargumma/Manohar_RTL2GDS) – End-to-end flow (RTL → GDS)  
- [BabySoC-Fundamentals-Functional-Modelling](https://github.com/manohargumma/BabySoC-Fundamentals-Functional-Modelling) – RTL & simulation focus  
- [Post-Synthesis-GLS-STA-Fundamentals](https://github.com/manohargumma/Post-Synthesis-GLS-STA-Fundamentals) – Gate level simulation + STA work  
- [INTRODUCTION-TO-CIRCUIT-DESIGN-AND-SPICE-SIMUATIONS](https://github.com/manohargumma/INTRODUCTION-TO-CIRCUIT-DESIGN-AND-SPICE-SIMUATIONS) – Supporting analog/verification portion  
- [OpenROAD-Installation-guide-BUILD-With-Docker](https://github.com/manohargumma/OpenROAD-Installation-guide--BUILD-With-Docker) – Tool setup documentation  
- [Physical-Design-Workshop](https://github.com/manohargumma/Physical-Design-Workshop) – Hands-on layout/placement practices  

By merging and building upon these, this new repository presents a **single comprehensive submission** as required by the Week 9 task.
